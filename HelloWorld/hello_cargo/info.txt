To create a Cargo use "cargo new *name of cargo*" and then cd into it
Calling cargo new makes a new git repo of one already doesn't exist

Within the Cargo.TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language)
[package] --> Things below this are configuring the package info
[dependencies] --> start of the section that lists all project dependencies

Packages of code are refered to as crates

Inside src/ the main.rs file resides has hello world by default
Source files go inside src
Top level is for README, license, confiug files, and anything else not code related

Building a Cargo

cargi build --> builds the package. Creates executable in target/debug/hello_cargo

./target/debug/hello_cargo --> runs executable

cargo run --> builds and executes. If file has been compiled before it will skip recompile

cargo check --> checks if your code compiles without executing or generating an executable. This is much faster than cargo build.

Typically people use cargo check to test periodically and then cargo build once done implementing

cargo.lock --> keeps track of exact versions of dependencies. SHOULD NEVER MODIFY MANUALLY
